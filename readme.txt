OBSERVATIONS /_\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The design was created using many absolute positions for more blocks and images. To make the web more responsive, i´m not
using that much amount of absolute positions. I also don´t recommend to create the designs on that way, because is not a 
good practice to create webpages using absolutes.
